# MTG-LLM

## Goals of this project

Make an MTG playing agent with high ELO that can operate in paper or online

I want it to operate in paper or online because i want to use it with friends, who play in paper.

I only play online in Arena and making Arena integration is likely against TOS and harder to show off to people.
